Dear Russel,

Thank you so much for a great rehearsal today. We developed the "guru" voice by rehearsing lines from "Breathe." We also we set up the plan for tackling the Homily going forward.

To begin rehearsal, we began with a guided meditation led by Yeshe Rabgye. We should continue to listen to these guided meditions throughout the week. I'll be paying attention to the filler words used to stretch out pauses without saying much. I'll also be listening to the tempo of the recitation.

As you read the text from "Breathe," I noticed a whisper quality in your voice that reminded me of Ocean Vuong. I liked how you drew from Vuong's whistling sibilants and sing-song incantation. Be careful, however, not to lose the slower "guru" tempo. 

Your instincts about which words to emphasize are excellent. Try a kind of reverse accenting. Instead of a punchy short delivery, stretch these notes oouutt and even pull back on the volume.

I'm am looking forward to hearing an audio sketch of your reciting the "Homily." I was very touched by your story about your father and the rainbows. Please send me something this weekend so I have some time to sit with it before our next rehearsal.

Two quick business notes: 
We will keep meeting on Tuesdays at 4:30. Could you also keep Monday 3/30 @ 5:30pm open as well as 4/11 in the afternoon? These are the times I can get us into the main hall.

Also, I am working on getting some costuming for us. Could you send me your measurements when you get a chance?

Excited to develop these scenes together with you. Feeling optimistic.

Sincerely,
Zach
